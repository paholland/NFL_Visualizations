### Project NFL_Visualizations (Team Project)

    To to tell a story through data visualizations.
    
Focus of this project is providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves.
Prepare a presentation that lays out a theme, coding approach, data
munging techniques, and final visualization.
May choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly.
 
Visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS,
JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
○ A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
○ A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
○ A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
○ A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior
to visualization (must be approved)

Project should include at least one new JS library.
Project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus,
dropdowns, textboxes).
